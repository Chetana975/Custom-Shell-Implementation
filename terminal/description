Project Description for Resume

Project Title: Custom Shell Implementation ("myshell")

Objective:
Developed a custom bash-like shell in C, named "myshell", which simulates common Linux commands (ls, ps, mv, and grep) with various options, providing a robust, user-friendly command-line interface.

Key Features:

    Custom Command Prompt: The shell displays a prompt in the format user@hostname:path to current dir, similar to a typical Linux terminal.
    Command Implementation: Core Linux commands (ls, ps, mv, grep) are implemented from scratch in C, supporting at least 4-5 options for each.
    Error Handling: The shell gracefully handles invalid commands and arguments, providing meaningful error messages without crashing.
    Help Command: Implemented a help command to show the correct usage of each supported command.
    Command History: Utilized the readline library to support navigation through recently used commands using the UP and DOWN arrow keys.
    Graceful Exit: Supported an exit command to terminate the shell process with a meaningful exit message.
    Command-Line Parsing: Used the getopt function for parsing command-line options, ensuring robust input handling.

Technologies Used:

    Programming Language: C
    Libraries: readline, getopt

Project Details:

    Developed a fully functional shell environment mimicking a typical Linux terminal.
    Implemented core Linux commands with various options:
        ls Command: Supports options like -l for detailed listing, -a for all files, including hidden files, etc.
        ps Command: Supports options like -e for all processes, -f for full-format listing, etc.
        mv Command: Supports options like -i for interactive move, -v for verbose output, etc.
        grep Command: Supports options like -i for case-insensitive search, -v for inverting match, etc.
    Enhanced user experience with robust error handling and help messages.
    Implemented command history to improve usability and efficiency.
    Ensured the shell process can be gracefully exited using the exit command.

Outcome:
Successfully created a custom shell environment that replicates the functionality of a Linux terminal, providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for executing common commands. The project demonstrated strong skills in system programming, command-line parsing, and user interface design in a terminal environment.
